Title: Efficient and Accurate P-Value Computation for Position Weight Matrices
Description: In putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) 
             identification from sequence/alignments,
             we are interested in the significance of certain match score.
             TFMPvalue provides the accurate calculation of P-value with 
             score threshold for Position Weight Matrices, 
             or the score with given P-value. 
             It is an interface to code originally made available by 
             Helene Touzet and Jean-Stephane Varre, 2007, 
             Algorithms Mol Biol:2, 15. <doi:10.1186/1748-7188-2-15>.
